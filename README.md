# Some Personal Codes

These are some codes that I have developed throughout my course of computer science at UFF (Federal Fluminense University - Rio de Janeiro - Brazil).


In this repository you may find some random personal projects in many different programming languages.


My purpose is to keep track of my progress and also access in multiple devices with my portable Linux Distro in an USB Stick (I'm still thinking whether or not I publish these configs I've done to my personal use in the USB stick).
